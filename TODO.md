 - DON'T TOUCH THE SAMPLE STRUCTURES ANYMORE
 - How to deal with oom/big data problems?
   - shrink footprint
     - change instances of string to an int and keep a map
       - main culprit is stack traces
       - proc task names can also be mapped
     - make footprint encapsulate more information
       - each footprint describes a timestamp-thread pair
         - each footprint has a collection of stack traces with call counts
         - each footprint has a collection of power estimations by component
     - how to handle big data
       - when we are consuming too much memory, we write to disk
         - we need a manager thread that tells the other workers to start/stop
         - do we stop eflect completely to do this or just suspend everyone?
       - pipe all data to disk
         - make each process create a file to push samples to
         - use a handler thread that is sent the data to consume and writes it to disk periodically
 - Why can't we get a good concept of activity from yappi?
   - samples contain ncalls instead of tsub (which is empty with these samples)
   - maybe we can have a timestamp window we watch and sample each time
     - this requires tracking on threads as well; we need a timestamp, a thread name, and a stack trace
     - maybe we can just add a timestamp field to the pit to indicate when it was sampled?
 - Add freq processing to check for calmness
   - there's already a script for this somewhere
